# Hungry-Panda

My first 2D Android Game. 

I wanted to learn something new while on break from University, so I decided to try out Android App Development. Learning all the features of Android was quite challenging as there were so many possibilites. Along the way, I learned some basic XML and sharpened my Java skills in the process.

The game is similar to games like Flappy Bird, where you need to guide a character through a gap between obstacles. However those games usually involving "jumping" and free falling through the obstacles where as in Hungry Panda, the movement is based on dragging the Panda up and down.
